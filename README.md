# Sparse-Time-Varying-Optimization
Code to reproduce the experiments of the paper "Centralized and distributed online learning for sparse time-varying optimization" by Sophie M. Fosson

Contacts: name.surname@polito.it

Three experiments:
1) CSI_1: Online compressed system idenfitication with paramaters varying as stepwise constant function

2) CSI_2: Online compressed system idenfitication with paramaters varying as a smooth oscillating function

3) LOCALIZATION: Target tracking via sensor network

C++ code
Requirements: g++ compiler, Eigen library http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/, Gnuplot

Optional: Matlab to merge files (merge.m)
